üéØ Objective

Identify the top 5 promotion-eligible employees in each department using structured SQL-based analysis on employee datasets. This project simulates a real-world HR analyst use case with PostgreSQL and Power BI.

üß™ Step-by-Step SQL Analysis

1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Exploration ‚Äî 1_data_exploration.sql

-- Count rows and missing fields
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE previous_year_rating IS NULL) AS null_rating
FROM train;

-- Age and training score range
SELECT MIN(age), MAX(age), AVG(avg_training_score) FROM train;

-- Overall promotion rate
SELECT COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE is_promoted = 1)::DECIMAL / COUNT(*) * 100 AS promotion_rate FROM train;

2Ô∏è‚É£ Promotion Score Formula ‚Äî 2_promotion_score.sql

-- Add weighted score based on logic
SELECT *,
  (CASE WHEN previous_year_rating >= 4 THEN 10 ELSE 3 END) +
  (CASE WHEN avg_training_score >= 85 THEN 10 ELSE 3 END) +
  (CASE WHEN "awards_won?" = 1 THEN 10 ELSE 0 END) +
  (CASE WHEN length_of_service >= 5 THEN 5 ELSE 2 END) +
  (CASE WHEN no_of_trainings >= 3 THEN 3 ELSE 1 END) AS promotion_score
INTO test_scored
FROM test;

3Ô∏è‚É£ Top 5 Candidates per Department ‚Äî 3_top5_per_department.sql

-- Rank and pick top 5 from each department
SELECT *
FROM (
  SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY promotion_score DESC) AS rank
  FROM test_scored
) AS ranked
WHERE rank <= 5;

4Ô∏è‚É£ Bonus View for BI ‚Äî views/hr_summary_view.sql

CREATE VIEW hr_promotion_summary AS
SELECT department, gender, education,
       COUNT(*) AS total,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE is_promoted = 1) AS promoted,
       ROUND(COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE is_promoted = 1)::DECIMAL / COUNT(*) * 100, 2) AS promotion_rate
FROM train
GROUP BY department, gender, education;

üîç Key Business Insights

‚úÖ High performance (rating ‚â• 4) and awards are top indicators for promotion.

üìà Employees with training scores above 85 have a higher chance.

üëÅÔ∏è Departmental patterns show uneven promotion rates ‚Äî needs policy check.

üí° What Can Be Improved?

Add Machine Learning scoring instead of rule-based.

Automate ranking with stored procedures.

Integrate with Power BI for HR Dashboards.
